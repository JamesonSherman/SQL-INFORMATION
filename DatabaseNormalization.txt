Database Normalization:
Database Normalization is the idea of reducing database redundancy 
and allowing for cleaner and more optimized flow of data via tables.
To reduce larger tables and redundant values being stored we are able to break our tables
into more efficient and clean sub tables that can be used just as well with less
overlap of data and with higher precision of concise values.


First Normal Form
Rules:
1. Each column should Be Atomic - one value per cell
2. Can not have similar columns with similar information
3. There should be a key.

key rules: split large tables into smaller tables with
relevant keys.


Second Normal Form
1. Adhere to all rules of first normal form
2. All non key columns should be dependent on primary key

TIP: You can use a Join table as an intersection table for multiple ID keys

Third Normal Form:
1. Adhere to all rules of First and Second Normal Form
2. All non key columns should be "non transitively" dependent on primary key
